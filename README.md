# Normal Net

Normal Net is a project that is designed to transform diffuse images into PBR Maps, currently focused on Normal Maps. Models areTrained using PyTorch and a GAN archetecture. The project is being created in order to allow for 3D artists to quicklycreate photorealistic renders without having to download and store many PBR Materials locally. Currently a Blender Plugin is being created to allow users to seamlessly incorprate the technology into the work.
